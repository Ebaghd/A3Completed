# a2: Writing Responses
Please  respond to the following two prompts.
## Think: Writing Prompt
O'Neil writes: "... I worried about the separation between technical models and real people, and about the moral repercussions of that separation" (p. 48). Please consider the Titanic data set, focussing especially on the features used to represent human beings. Giving one or more examples, please reflect on how those features create a separation between "the data" and the "real people." [60 - 100 words] [4 points]

> The titanic data set has features that represent ticket class, sex, age, whether they survived or not, and how many within their class fall under these categories. These features create a separation between "the data" and "real people" because the data normalizes the deaths of all these **real** people. The data does not correlate to the reality of death and what death means. It makes predictions on who gets to live and die - negating the tragedy of such an incident.

## Think: Envisioning Cards
If you like, please work in a group of 2 or more.

Please consider the Titanic data set, again, focussing on the features. Explore the Envisioning Cards and select three cards - any three cards you want. What new questions do the cards raise about the variables used to represent people. [6 points]

> (1) **Direct Stakeholders**. Those who directly interact with the system. In what key roles will individuals interact directly with the system? Crew for large passenger vessels - Very high percentage of women and children survived, yet only 16% of men survived. Men might be less inclined to be part of the crew.
Passenger classes - less percentage of men survived than women and children, therefore men might be less inclined to become passengers.

> (2)  **Value Tensions**. These occur when supporting one value in a technology challenges another value. More women and children survived than men on the Titanic - what makes their lives worth more? Generally, as passenger class went down, less percentage of people survived. What makes richer people's lives worth more? Do they deserve to live more than poorer people?

> (3)  **Non-targeted Use**. Technologies are not always used in ways that the designers intended. Who might use the system for unplanned/nefarious purposes? Ticket salesman may use survival rates as a factor in ticket class cost, terrorists may use this information to plan an attack, or other forms of transportation could use this fact to convince people not to board large vessels.
